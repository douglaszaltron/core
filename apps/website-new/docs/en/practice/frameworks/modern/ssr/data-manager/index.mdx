# introduce

This chapter will introduce common data request methods and their drawbacks, and briefly describe how Modern.js solves existing problems. Also shows how Module Federation uses this feature.

## Existing problems

In the past, in SSR mode, the producer component could not obtain data directly from the server, and could only load data asynchronously through consumer transparent transmission or using `Await/Suspense`.

This solution will load the corresponding page js resources and then initiate a network request. This process is a serial process, which means that if there are multiple layers of components, the performance of the first screen will be poor.

## Modern.js solution

In Modern.js, the framework will shard the route and obtain the static resources and data of the corresponding route, and then load the static resources and data in parallel.

## Used in Module Federation

There are different usage methods according to the calling scenario.

### Consumer

If you only use the Data Loader on the consumption page, then follow [Data Fetch](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/basic-features/data/data-fetch.html) and [Data Writing](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/basic-features/data/data-write.html) just use it.

### Producer

Because Data Loader needs to be bound to routing, regular producers cannot use this function, and the producer needs to be [route component] (../route-component).
