# Routing component

`@module-federation/modern-js` supports exporting route-level components. After export, consumers can consume the producer's routes in the corresponding project routes.

## How to enable this ability?

### Provider

Set `exportRoutes: true` in `@module-federation/modern-js` to automatically export routing components.

```diff title="modern.config.ts"
moduleFederationPlugin({
+   exportRoutes: true,
})
```
### Consumer

#### 1. Set `importRoutes: true` in `@module-federation/modern-js`

```diff title="modern.config.ts"
moduleFederationPlugin({
+   importRoutes: true,
})
```

#### 2. Create routing folder

Then follow [conventional routing](https://modernjs.dev/en/guides/concept/entries.html#conventional-routing) rule, create the corresponding routing folder `src/routes/mf-route`.

#### 3. Create `mf.json`

Create a file named `mf.json` in the folder you just created with the following content:

```json title='mf.json'
{
  "remoteName": "sub"
}
```

The value of `remoteName` is the producer name declared in `module-federation.config.ts`.

#### 4. Start the project

Start the project and you will find that `layout.tsx` will be generated under the newly created routing folder, with the following content:

```ts title='layout.tsx'
// Do not edit this file. It is a auto generated.
// It will render sub's layout.
// The layout pathname is: /mf-route
// The layout route id is: mf-route/layout
```

After accessing the corresponding route, you can observe that the producer's page has been loaded into the current consumer project normally.
